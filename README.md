# Logistic_Regression

## Author: Alexander Pepe

This is a Bibliographic reference about Logistic Regression using Iris dataset. For this project I used Jupyter Notebook to write the code and some of libraries as:

      - Pandas - Use to manipulate the dataset
      - Numpy - Use for mathematical computation
      - Seaborn - Use for graphical visualization
      - MatplotLib - Use for graphical visualization

I followed the article published at Towards Data Science, so I don't have credits for it. It was only for pratice and understand more about Logistic Regression.

We can find the article in  https://towardsdatascience.com/quick-and-easy-explanation-of-logistics-regression-709df5cc3f1e .
